## Technologies Used

- **React** - for most of the Framework.
- **React Router** - for the internal links and switching the content as we scroll down.
- **Github Pages** - For hosting.
- **Github** - for the version control/archiving.

React was the easiet framework for a single page application, however I wanted to switch between different versions of the same page. Which a later realised meant creating multiple version of the same page, each with unique css/class names in order to keep everything exactly as I'd set it.

There are no dependancies as the page is live. However if you want to take a look at the code a good knowledge of React would be helpful.
